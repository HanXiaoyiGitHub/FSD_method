# Fire and Smoke Detection with Representation of Burning Intensity
This repository is the official implementation of our paper titled "Fire and Smoke Detection with Representation of Burning Intensity". It includes our Fire and Smoke Detection (FSD) method code and several General Object Detection (SSD, RetinaNet, Faster RCNN, FCOS, and our method). We standardized the coding style for easier use. The repository will be made available until it is accepted.
